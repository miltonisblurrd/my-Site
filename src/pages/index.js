      text="You might catch me cruising on my board, listening to music, or writing on walls. I give credit to Skateboarding, Music, and Graffiti for inspiring me. I am Passionate for several Design fields. I really enjoy the idea of Creating new things and Improving the User Experience of todayâ€™s world through Innovation and Design thinking. 

      BLURRD Develop & Design is a Studio based in Las Vegas. Focusing on Design & Mobile/Web Development. 
      
      I have a year and a half experience in UI/UX Design, previously for Blinds USA. If I am not working with a Product Owner I stay brushed up on my skills by working on Personal projects, Mobile/Web Redesigns, & UI Daily Challenges. 

      As a Designer and Junior Developer, I bring together Structure and Function to create something that looks great and performs better. 

      Alongside my clients, I uncover problems and solve them.
